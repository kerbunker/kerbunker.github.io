# Portfolio Challenge

## A portfolio of my current work

### Content includes

* A navigation section with a link to my resume
* An about me section
* Links to examples of my work
* My contact info including links to social media

### Features included

* A navigation bar that links to the corresponding setion
* Images that function as links
    * These images are also slightly transparent but they become fully opaque when they are hovered over
* The use of flexbox to help keep things spaced properly
* Media queries to change the layout of the page for better viewing on smaller screens
    * This includes having section titles stack in a column instead of in-line to help with spacing
    * Images become the same sizes and are no longer in line to help enable small screen use
    * Contact links stack in a column instead of overlapping in a row

#### Challenges to work on

Through this challenge, I had to overcome many obstacle. Most of the obstacles were regarding spacing. I thought I fixed an issue and then suddenly broke 3 more elements that were previously working. Flexbox proved very helpful for spacing the work links properly even when the page size was changed, but it seemed to cause problems for other parts of the page. These spacing problems and the use of flexbox will certainly be things I will want to practice to become more accustomed to them.
